# HealthWatch
It is a lightweight, cross-platform system utility designed to monitor essential security and health configurations on client machines. It runs silently in the background, periodically checking for system issues like disk encryption status, OS updates, and sleep settings. Changes are securely reported to a central server for real-time monitoring.
